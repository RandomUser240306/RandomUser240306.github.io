<h1>History of the Internet</h1>
<ol>
<li><h3>The Beginning: DARPA and the ARPANET</h3><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The concept of an network from computer to computer that would interconnect the world started mainly with DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). DARPA is only takes orders from the Department of Defense and is committed to developing better technology than any other branch, which is why a military department was one of the first to go through with such an idea. It supported the ARPANET (Advanced Research Products Agency Network), which was an early network that used packet-switching (the information being guided towards the receiver by a header and the information being contained in the payload) and the first to use TCP/IP addresses (the way that our modern computers find websites on the Internet). It was the precursor to the modern Internet, and was decommissioned in 1990.</p></li>
<li><h3>Going Public</h3><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Internet started being publicly used around mid-1989 for e-mails. The highest data speeds in those days were 45 Mbit/s, which is decently fast, but nothing compared to today's highest internet speed, more than 33,000 times faster! Nine years later, Google was founded, and still is the leading producer of Internet services.</li>
